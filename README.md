## Overview

This repository contains all the analysis and simulation code used to explore how inducible filamentation in *Escherichia coli* modulates survival under stress. We combined experimental assays (microchemostat, flow cytometry, and mother machine) with a simple mathematical model to quantify toxin accumulation and investigate the protective role of filamentation under exposure to antibiotics and heavy metals.

## Image Analysis Code

**[py_MotherMachine.py](py_MotherMachine.py)**  
Python script for processing kymograph data from mother machine experiments. Extracts single-cell trajectories to quantify elongation rates, division timing, and survival outcomes under different stress conditions.

**[muPy_viewer.py](muPy_viewer.py)**  
Interactive Python tool for manual correction of segmentation and tracking errors in microchemostat time-lapse experiments. Supports frame-by-frame validation of cell trajectories and fluorescence intensity measurements.
